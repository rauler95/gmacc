# Instructions

To use any of this scrips, you need to create first a NN (see example 02). Further you must link your trained NNs to the directory where the files are stored in. The output products are most likely stored also in the directory of your trained NNs.

Also make sure your trained NNs are capable of the requirements you give to them, e.g. input parameter range and output parameters.
